# Real-time Multilingual Custom Keyword Spotting via Few Shot Learning
- a low-latency few-shot keyword spotting (FS-KWS) for personalization of keyword spotting  or wakeword detection running in real-time on an edge device.
- customization achieved by recording audio from user for less than 30 seconds, then segmenting speaker's audio to 1-second speech audio files via a deep learning model. Segmented audio files then used to fine-tune and customize an efficinetnet-B0 based multilingual keyword spotting model through few-shot leanring. The baseline model that we used in this study is based on [harvard-edge](https://github.com/harvard-edge/multilingual_kws) work.
- Processing time for each 1-second audio chunk is 60 ms.
