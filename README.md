# Real-time Multilingual Custom Keyword Spotting via Few Shot Learning
- Proposing a lightweight few-shot keyword spotting (FS-KWS) for personalization of keyword spotting or wake-word detection running in real-time on an edge device.
- The customization is achieved by recording audio from the user for less than 30 seconds, then segmenting the speaker's audio to 1-second speech audio files via a deep learning model. Segmented audio files were then used to fine-tune and customize an efficientnet-B0-based multilingual keyword spotting model through few-shot learning. The baseline model that we used in this study is based onÂ [Harvard-edge](https://github.com/harvard-edge/multilingual_kws)Â work.
- Observed processing time for each 1-second audio chunk observed was 60 ms.
